# MiddleEarthMap
#### Description

For giggles, I wanted to see what a Middle Earth mod might look like for Delusions of Grandeur: Rome. The textures were kindly provided by u/enpremi from the Rise of Mordor team.

#### Conclusion
We should develop mod tools aimed at lightening the workload inherent in total conversion mods. As it stands, it would take a pretty dedicated individual to see a mod like this through to completion.
